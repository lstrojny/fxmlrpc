[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lstrojny/fxmlrpc.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/lstrojny/fxmlrpc) [![Average time to resolve an issue](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/resolution/lstrojny/fxmlrpc.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/lstrojny/fxmlrpc "Average time to resolve an issue") [![Percentage of issues still open](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/open/lstrojny/fxmlrpc.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/lstrojny/fxmlrpc "Percentage of issues still open")

 - A convenient, object oriented API (similar to the XML/RPC client in Zend Framework)
 - Very fast serializing and parsing of the XML payloads involved
 - Stick to the HTTP client you already use provided by [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/)
 - Licensed under the terms of the liberal MIT license
 - Supports modern standards: easy installation via composer, fully PSR-0, PSR-1 and PSR-2 compatible
 - Relentlessly unit- and integration tested
 - Implements all known XML/RPC extensions

## Upgrading to 0.23.x
Instead of `php-http/message-factory`, we now use the PSR-7 compatible `RequestFactoryInterface`. You will have to change your custom HTTP client implementation and pass a `Psr\Http\Message\RequestFactoryInterface` implementation, a `Psr\Http\Message\StreamFactoryInterface` and a `Http\Client\HttpClient` to the `HttpAdapterTransport`.
See below for details.

## Installation
To install fxmlrpc run this command:

```
composer require lstrojny/fxmlrpc
```

### Install dependencies

You must choose three packages for for the business of HTTP:
- A PSR-7 compatible HTTP message (request / response) implementation
- A compatible HTTP RequestFactoryInterface and StreamFactoryInterface implementations to create HTTP messages
- A PSR-7 compatible HTTP client
Two widespread message implementations are [laminas/laminas-diactoros](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros) and [guzzle/psr7](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7). Message factories for both implementations are available in [php-http/message](https://github.com/php-http/message).
For HTTP clients you can pick e.g.[php-http/guzzle7-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle7-adapter), [php-http/guzzle6-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle6-adapter), [php-http/guzzle5-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle5-adapter), [php-http/curl-client](https://github.com/php-http/curl-client) or [php-http/buzz-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/buzz-adapter).

Example:

```
composer require php-http/message php-http/guzzle7-adapter
```

### Instantiating `HttpAdapterTransport`
An example instantiation using Guzzle6:
```php
$httpClient = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$httpClient->...();
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    new fXmlRpc\Transport\HttpAdapterTransport(
        new \Http\Message\MessageFactory\DiactorosMessageFactory(),
        new \Http\Message\StreamFactory\DiactorosStreamFactory(),
        new \Http\Adapter\Guzzle7\Client($httpClient)
    )
);
```

## Upgrading to 0.12.x
Instead of `egeloen/http-adapter`, we now use the PSR-7 compatible `php-http/httplug`. You will have to change your custom HTTP client implementation and pass a `Http\Message\MessageFactory` implementation and a `Http\Client\HttpClient` to the `HttpAdapterTransport`.
See below for details.

## Installation
To install fxmlrpc run this command:

```
composer require lstrojny/fxmlrpc
```

### Install dependencies

You must choose three packages for for the business of HTTP:
  - A PSR-7 compatible HTTP message (request / response) implementation
  - A compatible HTTP message factory implementation to create HTTP messages
  - A PSR-7 compatible HTTP client
Two widespread message implementations are [zend-diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros) and [guzzle/psr7](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7). Message factories for both implementations are available in [php-http/message](https://github.com/php-http/message).
For HTTP clients you can pick e.g. [php-http/guzzle6-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle6-adapter), [php-http/guzzle5-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle5-adapter), [php-http/curl-client](https://github.com/php-http/curl-client) or [php-http/buzz-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/buzz-adapter).

Example:

```
composer require zendframework/zend-diactoros php-http/message php-http/guzzle6-adapter
```

### Instantiating `HttpAdapterTransport`
An example instantiation using Guzzle6:
```php
$httpClient = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$httpClient->...();
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    new fXmlRpc\Transport\HttpAdapterTransport(
        new \Http\Message\MessageFactory\DiactorosMessageFactory(),
        new \Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client($httpClient)
    )
);
```

## Upgrading to 0.11.x
We change `ParserInterface::parse()` method interface, now isn't required to pass second parameter ($isFault), parser should throw an exception FaultException when fault message is encountered in server response.

## Upgrading to 0.10.x
0.10.x comes with a couple of breaking changes: We used to ship our own bridges for interoperability with various HTTP clients but moved that responsibility to a 3rd party library called [Ivory HTTP Adapter](https://github.com/egeloen/ivory-http-adapter).
*IMPORTANT NOTE:* the library is not installed by default as you could choose to use fxmlrpc with just your own implementation of the `fXmlRpc\Transport\TransportInterface`. To install the library – and that’s what you most likely want – add this line to your `composer.json`

```
"egeloen/http-adapter": "~0.6"
```

… and run `composer update`

### Instantiating an HTTP transport
In order to use the new adapters, you need to change how you instantiate fXmlRpc and its transport. This is how instantiating a custom transport looked before:

```php
$httpClient = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    new fXmlRpc\Transport\Guzzle4Bridge($httpClient)
);
```

This is how you do it now:
```php
$httpClient = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$httpClient->...();
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    new fXmlRpc\Transport\HttpAdapterTransport(new Ivory\HttpAdapter\GuzzleHttpHttpAdapter($httpClient))
);
```

### How fast is it really?

IO performance is out of reach from a userspace perspective, but parsing and
serialization speed is what matters. How fast can we generate the XML payload
from PHP data structures and how fast can we parse the servers response? fXmlRpc
uses stream based XML writers/readers to achieve it’s performance and heavily
optimizes (read uglifies) for it. As as result the userland version is only
around 2x slower than the native C implementation (ext/xmlrpc).


#### Parser
```
Zend\XmlRpc\Value (ZF2): 249.02972793579 sec
Zend_XmlRpc_Value (ZF1): 253.88145494461 sec
fXmlRpc\Parser\XmlReaderParser: 36.274516105652 sec
fXmlRpc\Parser\NativeParser: 18.652323007584 sec
```

#### Serializer
```
Zend\XmlRpc\Request (ZF2): 52.004573106766 sec
Zend_XmlRpc_Request (ZF1): 65.042532920837 sec
fXmlRpc\Serializer\XmlWriterSerializer: 23.652673006058 sec
fXmlRpc\Serializer\NativeSerializer: 9.0790779590607 sec
```


### Usage

#### Basic Usage
```php
<?php
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client('http://endpoint.com');
$client->call('remoteMethod', array('arg1', true));
```

#### Using native (ext/xmlrpc based) serializer/parser (for even better performance)
```php
<?php
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    null,
    new fXmlRpc\Parser\NativeParser(),
    new fXmlRpc\Serializer\NativeSerializer()
);
$client->call('remoteMethod', array('arg1', true));
```

#### Prepending and appending arguments
```php
<?php
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client('http://endpoint.com');
$client->prependParams(array('username', 'password'));
$client->appendParams(array('appended'));
...
```

#### Using a convenient Proxy object
```php
<?php
$proxy = new fXmlRpc\Proxy(new fXmlRpc\Client('http://endpoint.com'));
// Call system.echo
$proxy->system->echo('Hello World!');
```

#### Tracking XML of the request and response
```php
<?php
$transport = new fXmlRpc\Transport\HttpAdapterTransport(...);
$recorder = new Recorder($transport);
$client = new Client('http://foo.com', $recorder);
$client->call('TestMethod', ['param1', 2, ['param3' => true]]);

$lastRequest = $recorder->getLastRequest();
$lastResponse = $recorder->getLastResponse();
```

If exception occur in the transport layer you can get it using `getLastException()`.

### Helpful abstraction for multicall requests
```php
<?php
$result = $client->multicall()
    ->addCall('system.add', array(1, 2))
    ->addCall(
        'system.add',
        array(2, 3),
        function ($result) {
            echo "Result was: " . $result;
        },
        function($result) {
            echo "An error occured: " . var_export($result, true);
        }
    )
    ->onSuccess(function ($result) {echo "Success";}) // Success handler for each call
    ->onError(function ($result) {echo "Error";}) // Error handler for each call
    ->execute();
```

#### Integration for various HTTP clients using [Ivory](https://github.com/egeloen/ivory-http-adapter)
```php
<?php
/** Buzz (https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz) */
$browser = new Buzz\Browser();
$browser->...();
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    new fXmlRpc\Transport\HttpAdapterTransport(new \Ivory\HttpAdapter\BuzzHttpAdapter($browser))
);

/** Zend Framework 1 (http://framework.zend.com/) */
$httpClient = new Zend_Http_Client();
$httpClient->...();
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    new fXmlRpc\Transport\HttpAdapterTransport(new \Ivory\HttpAdapter\Zend1HttpAdapter($httpClient))
);

/** Zend Framework 2 (http://framework.zend.com/zf2) */
$httpClient = new Zend\Http\Client();
$httpClient->...();
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    new fXmlRpc\Transport\HttpAdapterTransport(new \Ivory\HttpAdapter\Zend2HttpAdapter($httpClient))
);

/** Guzzle (http://guzzlephp.org/) */
$httpClient = new Guzzle\Http\Client();
$httpClient->...();
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    new fXmlRpc\Transport\HttpAdapterTransport(new \Ivory\HttpAdapter\GuzzleAdapter($httpClient))
);

/** Guzzle 4+ (http://guzzlephp.org/) */
$httpClient = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$httpClient->...();
$client = new fXmlRpc\Client(
    'http://endpoint.com',
    new fXmlRpc\Transport\HttpAdapterTransport(new \Ivory\HttpAdapter\GuzzleHttpHttpAdapter($httpClient))
);
```

#### Timing XML/RPC requests to find problematic calls
fXmlRpc allows you to time your XML/RPC request, to find out which took how long. It provides a
`fXmlRpc\Timing\TimingDecorator` which can be used with various timers implementing
`fXmlRpc\Timing\TimerInterface`. Currently implemented are bridges for Monolog, Zend Framework 1
`Zend_Log` and Zend Framework 2 `Zend\Log`.

Usage:
```php
<?php
$client = new fXmlRpc\Timing\TimingDecorator(
    new fXmlRpc\Client(...),
    new fXmlRpc\Timing\MonologTimerBridge(
        $monolog,
        Monolog\Logger::ALERT,
        'My custom log message template %F'
    )
);
```
